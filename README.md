Project overview document


The business requirements and goals involve creating an automated process for requesting loaner vehicles through a self-service portal to replace the current manual process. This change is sought to address delays in obtaining vehicles, which hinder contractors' daily operations. The proposed project will manage vehicle inventory, track availability, and streamline the request, approval, and delivery process into a single flow.
